        "prompt": "Style & Context: \"A photorealistic, vertical, digital printout of a minimalist, modern invoice document. The final image should be a flat, straight-on view, as if the document is resting on a clean, off-white surface. The style must be clean, precise, and devoid of any extra graphic elements, icons, or unnecessary lines.\"|||Document Structure (Enforcing HTML/SCSS Layout): \"The entire invoice content must be contained within a single, centered Pure White (#ffffff) rectangle. This white document has slightly rounded corners, a thin Light Border (#e9ecef), and a subtle, soft, blurred shadow (box-shadow: 0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)), giving it a raised, elevated appearance.\"|||Header Section (Enforcing invoice-header layout): \"The top section is divided into two parts, separated by a thin, medium gray horizontal line (#dee2e6) across the full width. Left Side (Company Logo): Display the text 'YourLogo.co'. The word 'YourLogo' is bold, using Very Dark Gray (#212529). The suffix '.co' is lighter and subdued, using a Medium Gray (#495057). Right Side (Invoice Title): Text must be perfectly right-aligned. The main word is 'INVOICE' in Light Gray (#adb5bd), uppercase, and a slightly smaller font. Below it, the invoice number '#INV-XXXXX' is displayed in a Darker Gray (#6c757d).\"|||Totals Section (Enforcing justify-content: flex-end): \"The middle section must contain a large, empty area for line items. Crucially, the Invoice Totals section (the main calculation block) is positioned and strictly aligned to the far right edge of the page, occupying approximately 40% of the document width, leaving the left side blank, exactly as if using justify-content: flex-end.\"|||Footer Section (Enforcing invoice-footer style): \"At the very bottom, a faint, thin, light gray horizontal line separates the main content from the footer. The text 'Thank you for your business! Payment is due within 30 days.' must be centered and rendered in a faint, light gray text (#adb5bd).\"|||Summary of Colors (Strictly enforced): \"Use only the following limited color palette: Pure White (#ffffff) for the background of the document; Very Dark Gray/Black (#212529) for primary text; Medium Gray (#495057) and Darker Gray (#6c757d) for subtle text and secondary elements; Light Gray (#adb5bd) for titles and faint accents; and very light gray lines (#e9ecef, #dee2e6) for borders.\""

The overall aesthetic should be professional and spacious.\nHeader:\nOn the top left, the company logo should appear as the text: \"YourLogo.co\" where \"YourLogo\" is bold/darker and \".co\" is lighter/subdued.\nOn the top right, the invoice title should be clearly visible:\nThe word \"INVOICE\" in light gray, uppercase, and a slightly smaller font.\nBelow it, the text \"#INV-XXXXX\" in a darker gray.\nMain Content Area (Invoice Totals Section): A large empty section in the middle/upper-middle of the page, where the invoice-totals would be. This area should occupy approximately 40% of the document's height, positioned to the right side to reflect justify-content: flex-end.\nFooter:\nA light gray, thin horizontal line should separate the footer from the main content.\nCentered at the bottom, the faint gray text: \"Thank you for your business! Payment is due within 30 days.\"\nStyle & Color Palette (referencing bill-skeleton.scss):\nBackground: Off-white or very light gray.\nDocument: Pure White (#ffffff) background with a soft, subtle shadow (box-shadow: 0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)) and a thin, light border (#e9ecef).\nColors: Use a minimal palette:\nPrimary Text: Very Dark Gray/Black (#212529).\nSubtle/Accent Text (Invoice Title): Light to Medium Gray (#adb5bd, #6c757d).\nDividers: Light Gray (#dee2e6, #e9ecef).\nPerspective: Flat, straight-on view, as if looking at a printed document on a desk."
